## 📝 Overview

- First attempt at Test Driven Development (TDD) after doing the Jest and Enzyme course on Udemy by Bonnie Schulkin.

- I wanted to code a simple page to use the knowledge I learnt from the Udemy course. I chose a simple one page form as there is **a lot of testing to do even for a simple page.**

## 💾 Technologies

- JavaScript
- React
- Jest
- Enzyme
- Material UI

## 📝 Planning

![describe-example](https://i.ibb.co/Nxjh6Tw/describe-example.png)

- **This was the first time I tried TDD** and to really think about what tests was needed for each element and component **really made me think about the why.**

## ⛏ Challenges

- Really **planning each test and what it achieves**.

- Using the **`mock` functions effectively**.
