## 📝 Overview

- First attempt at Test Driven Development (TDD) after doing the Jest and Enzyme course on Udemy by Bonnie Schulkin.

- I wanted to code a simple page to use the knowledge I learnt from the Udemy course. I chose a simple one page form as there is a lot of testing to do even for a simple page.

## 💾 Technologies

- JavaScript
- React
- Jest
- Enzyme
- Material UI
